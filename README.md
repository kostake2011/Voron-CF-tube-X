# Voron-CF-tube-X

Hi all. Inspired by the project https://github.com/Woki-Leo/Carbonfiber-X-Axis?spm=5261.im.0.0.42d64edfKq04fY , it was decided to make a beam with thicker walls from CF pipe 20 * 20 * 17 and without holes at the back for fastening rails to get maximum rigidity.
The seller on Aliexpress- CARBON TIME Official Store decided to help us with this and carry out cutting and drilling of CF pipe in the factory.

Comrades https://github.com/alexandrsk8 and https://github.com/Solders2004 kindly provided the STL for installing the beam.
