# Voron-CF-tube-X

Hi all. Inspired by the project https://github.com/Woki-Leo/Carbonfiber-X-Axis?spm=5261.im.0.0.42d64edfKq04fY , it was decided to make a beam with thicker walls from CF pipe 20 * 20 * 17 and without holes at the back for fastening rails to get maximum rigidity.
The seller on Aliexpress- CARBON TIME Official Store decided to help us with this and carry out cutting and drilling of CF pipe in the factory.

Comrades https://github.com/alexandrsk8 and https://github.com/Solders2004 kindly provided the STL for installing the beam.


The assembly is pretty simple. We print from ABS Rail_Nut Guide.STL (for 300 and 350 Voron -x2). And Rail_Nut_assistant.STL . Insert M3 nuts into the Rail_Nut Guide, insert into the beam, center with holes for the rail. Press Rail_Nut_assistant (see picture). And fasten the rail. The printed parts can then be removed from the beam.
From the edges of the beam we insert M5_nut_holder (also printed from ABS), with M5 nuts pre-installed in them.

After that, we insert the beam into the joints and tighten the M5 screws. We take joints for CF pipes from Woki-Leo (link at the top of the page). Everyone, you lightened your Voron)
